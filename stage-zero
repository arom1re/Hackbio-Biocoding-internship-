# Stage zero Task
This project involved using any programming language of choice (mine was R) to organize basic information about oneself via data structure.

## Explanation of Code
The code consists of the following steps:

**Assigning values to variables:**
- My name was assigned to a variable
- My slack username was assigned to a variable
- My email address was assigned to a variable
- My hobby was assigned to a variable
- My country was assigned to a variable
- My discipline was assigned to a variable
- My programming language of choice was assigned to a variable

**Printing the variables:**
- I used the print(variable) function to print those variables

name <- "Rashid"
print(name)

slack_username <- "Rashid"
print(slack_username)

Email <- "olrsule@gmail.com"
print(Email)

Hobby <- "Hiking"
print(Hobby)

Country <- "Benin"
print(Country)

Discipline <- "Molecular and Cell Biology"
print(Discipline)

Program.lang <- "R"
print(Program.lang)

## Output
